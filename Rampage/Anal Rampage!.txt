Combat Ideas - strategical advantages for playing well



Units should deal damage to each other similtaneously?


Max number of times a unit can deal damage in defence?
- its a bit weird that a warrior could get lucky and deal 10 lots of damage in defence in the same turn
- maybe limit to 1-3 so defender can be overwhelmed by lots of units

or Unit fatigues with repeated defensive battles?
-each battle reduces defenders chance to hit by 10%


Unit HP affects combat hit chance but to a much lower degree than original?
- maybe unit incurrs a  No penalty for 60 - 100% of max HP
                       10% penalty for 30 - 60% of max HP 
	               25% penalty for 0 - 30% of max HP
- so only severely wounded unit loses performance


Wounded unit loses movement point?
- unit could lose -1 movement for HP <= 50% of max HP


More abilities and/or spells that can hold units in place so you can out manouvre your opponent?


Units that are large or special (elephant) that use up all the stack size but do something no other unit can do? 
- maybe hits all units in stack
- maybe 100% chance to hit
- has a lot of HP to counteract it being a single unit
- maybe has more upkeep as well
- maybe buffs all units within range 1 (make unit positioning more important in battle)
- normal unit uses 20cap, special uses 45cap. Flat terrain has 60cap max and featured terrain has 45cap mac.
  terrain cap  45 60
  units        20 20
               20 20
                  20
                or
  another?     30 20
                  30
              
                  30
	          30        
                or
  specials     45 45


Surround bonus?
