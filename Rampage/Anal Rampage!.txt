More abilities and/or spells that can hold units in place so you can out manouvre your opponent?


Units that are large or special (elephant) that use up all the stack size but do something no other unit can do? 
- maybe hits all units in stack
- maybe 100% chance to hit
- has a lot of HP to counteract it being a single unit
- maybe has more upkeep as well
- maybe buffs all units within range 1 (make unit positioning more important in battle)
- normal unit uses 20cap, special uses 45cap. Flat terrain has 60cap max and featured terrain has 45cap mac.
