Anal Rampage!

Unit Stats
- Cost: How many hammers it takes to build unit (lower cost overall?)
- Movement: How many tiles the unit can move
- HP: How much damage it can take from enemy units before dying
    : Start with 20 HP for Warrior ???
- Strength: How much damage (in HP) it deals to enemy unit                             <- have attack and defence strength, can create more classes of units
          : Start with 10 Strength for Warrior ???
- Dexterity: Chance to hit enemy unit (takes enemy dexterity in mind)                  <- combat calculator should show: chance of you hitting enemy, damage you will do, enemy HP (green)
           : Start with 10 Dexterity for Warrior ???                                                                     chance of them hitting you, damage they will do, your HP (red)
                                                                                                                         modifiers involved
Combat
- How does terrain affect combat? - Increased Dexterity for defender? (chance to hit)  <- my preference
                                  - Increased Strength for defender? (damage dealt)
                                  - Magnitude of bonus?                                <- 20% bonus to Dexterity
- Which unit defends first?                                                            <- 
- Surround Bonus?                                                                      <- my preference is to remove it, simplify game, speed up game
