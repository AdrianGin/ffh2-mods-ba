**DOESN'T WORK**

**Units which can fight must be inside city to scrap. - Make it so captured workers can be deleted (or they should be destroyed as they are captured)
---workers must still be in city to be deleted!

**Fix weapon upgrades stacking eg/swordsman can have copper and iron at the same time!
---units can still buy all the upgrades and they stack
---Also the promotions keeps reappearing each turn, can be bought multiple times for money(they dont stack however), hide the promotions they already have?



***WORKS***

***Can cast spells even if out of moves seems to work. (not sure what this was for, i'm pretty sure it already worked that way/Blinding light however still stops spellcastiing!)
***slow, seems to work - hard to check
***Scorch, works as expected
***Enchanted blade, works as expected
***Vitalize, added and works as expected. (would like to see it take 1-2 turns to terraform like bloom)
***Rust, removed

***Remove "build culture"
***Remove "build research"
***Remove "build wealth"

***Implement upgrades: gunpowder.
